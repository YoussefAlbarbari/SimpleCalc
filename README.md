# Explain the code
The add(a, b) function adds two numbers a and b and returns the result.

The subtract(a, b) function subtracts the second number b from the first number a and returns the result.

The divide(a, b) function divides the first number a by the second number b and handles the division by zero error by catching the ZeroDivisionError exception. If a division by zero occurs, it prints an error message and returns None.

The multiply(a, b) function multiplies two numbers a and b and returns the result.

The calculate_percentage(value, percentage) function calculates the percentage of a value by multiplying the value by the given percentage divided by 100.

The calculate_percentage_change(old_value, new_value) function calculates the percentage change between two values by subtracting the old value from the new value, dividing the difference by the old value, and multiplying the result by 100. It also handles the division by zero error by catching the exception and printing an error message.

In the provided code, the clear_result() function is defined but not currently used or called within the code. It appears to be intended for clearing the result or resetting the result variable, but it is not utilized in the current implementation of the calculator.

The clear_result() function simply assigns an empty string ("") to a variable named result_label. However, this variable is not referenced or used anywhere else in the code. Therefore, calling clear_result() does not have any effect on the functionality or behavior of the calculator.

The calculate() function is the main function that performs the calculation based on the user's input. It retrieves the selected operation, the first number, and the second number from user input. It checks if the input numbers are valid (numeric) using the isdigit() method. If the numbers are valid, they are converted to float type, and the corresponding operation is performed based on the user's choice. The result is then printed.

The calculator() function starts by printing a welcome message and displaying the available operations. It prompts the user to enter the first number, the second number, and the desired operation. Finally, it calls the calculate() function to perform the calculation.

To use this calculator, you can run the code, and it will prompt you for input to perform the desired calculation.
